1. **Login to AWS Account**
   - Access your AWS Management Console using your credentials.

2. **Create Key Pair**
   - Generate a key pair in the EC2 dashboard to enable SSH access to instances created, particularly for the Elastic Beanstalk instance.

3. **Create Security Groups**
   - Define security groups in the VPC service for different components like Elasticache, RDS, and Amazon MQ to control inbound and outbound traffic according to the requirements of each service.

4. **Create AWS Resources**
   - **RDS**: Launch an RDS instance to manage your databases.
   - **Amazon ElastiCache**: Set up ElastiCache to improve the performance of your applications by allowing retrieval of information from fast, managed, in-memory caches, rather than relying solely on slower disk-based databases.
   - **Amazon MQ**: Deploy Amazon MQ which is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ that makes it easy to set up and operate message brokers in the cloud.

5. **Create Elastic Beanstalk Environment**
   - Set up an Elastic Beanstalk environment that automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, and auto-scaling to application health monitoring.

6. **Update Security Groups**
   - Adjust the security group settings for the backend to allow traffic from the Elastic Beanstalkâ€™s security group, ensuring communication between services.

7. **Launch EC2 Instance for DB Initialization**
   - Deploy an EC2 instance to initialize the database, configure this instance with the necessary scripts or commands to set up the initial state of your database.

8. **Initialize Database on EC2 Instance**
   - SSH into the newly created EC2 instance and run the database initialization scripts or perform manual setup tasks to prepare your EDB (EnterpriseDB) database.

9. **Modify Health Check Settings in Beanstalk**
   - Configure the Elastic Beanstalk health check path to `/login` to ensure that the service is operational and handling requests properly.

10. **Add HTTPS Listener to ELB**
    - Configure the Elastic Load Balancer to listen on port 443 to handle HTTPS traffic, ensuring secure communications.

11. **Build Backend Artifact**
    - Compile or package your backend application, including all necessary configurations such as database endpoints and credentials.

12. **Deploy Artifacts to Elastic Beanstalk**
    - Upload and deploy the compiled artifacts to your Elastic Beanstalk environment to update the application with the latest codebase.

13. **Create CDN with SSL Certificate**
    - Set up a Content Delivery Network with an SSL certificate to reduce latency, increase security, and ensure fast delivery of content to users globally.

14. **Update DNS Entries**
    - Update the DNS records to point to your Elastic Beanstalk environment or CDN, depending on your architecture, to route user requests to the correct endpoints.

15. **Test Application URL**
    - Access the application through the defined URL to verify that the deployment is successful and the application is behaving as expected under the new configurations.
